# Lib-Pico8
A [Pico-8][p8] library of useful common functions.

It should be noted that as of April 11 2016, the library has just been published rather hastily. A lot of the code has not yet been refined or even tested, so use at your own risk. Contributions are very welcome and highly encouraged. Full documentation coming soon!

IMPORTANT NOTE: Pico-8 uses a subset of Lua, so a lot of the code here may not be compatible with actual Lua.
